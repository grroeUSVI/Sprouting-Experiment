This project coducts analysis on the sprouting experiment data and contains all the analysis and plots made when exploring the data along with a clean RMD with only code that ended up being used for the publication draft

In the Sprouting Experiment RMD

In this code there are examples of 
  testing ANVOA assumptions, 
  attempting transformations, 
  running Kruskall Wallis tests and
  Dunn post hoc tests including 
  tranlating post hoc results into letters indicating significant difference between groups for plots

 Making multilayer ggplots, violin plot, sinaplot (https://datavizpyr.com/sinaplot-vs-violin-plot-why-sinaplot-is-better-than-violinplot/), boxplot
 Custom color selections for ggplot
  writing a function, and using a function to create mulitiple similar plots of different variables
  italisizing in ggplot
  combining multiple plots using patchwork and gridarrange
  testing for differences in propagule bouyancy using chi squared test
  multi logistic regression/model selection with AIC
  nonparametric two way ANOVA (scheirerRayHare Test)
